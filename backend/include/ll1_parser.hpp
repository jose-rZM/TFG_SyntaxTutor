     * during parsing. It is used to guide the LL(1) parser's decisions based on
     * the current non-terminal and the next input symbol.
     *
     * The table is structured as:
     * - Outer map: Keys are non-terminal symbols (std::string).
     * - Inner map: Keys are input symbols (std::string), and values are vectors
     *   of productions (std::vector<production>) that can be applied.
